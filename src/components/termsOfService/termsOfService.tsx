          As part of the Site, Tempus provides access to the decentralized finance application Tempus Protocol on the
          Ethereum blockchain, that allows suppliers and borrowers of certain cryptoassets to earn yields using smart
          contracts (“Smart Contracts”).
          <br />
          <br />
          Using the Tempus Protocol may require that you pay a fee, such as gas costs on the Ethereum network, to
          perform a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that Tempus has no control over any transactions made over
          Tempus Protocol, the method of payment of any transactions or any actual payments of transactions.
          Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable cryptocurrency tokens stored
          at your Tempus Protocol-compatible wallet address (“Cryptocurrency Wallet”) to complete any transaction on the
          Tempus Protocol or the Ethereum network before initiating such transaction.

        <Typography variant="body-text" color="inverted">
          You acknowledge that the Site and your use of the Site contain certain risks, including without limitation the
          following risks:
          <ul>
            <li>
              That any Smart Contracts you interact with are entirely your own responsibility and liability, and that
              Tempus is not party to the Smart Contracts.
            </li>
            <li>
              At any time, your access to your cryptoassets may be suspended or terminated or there may be a delay in
              your access or use of your cryptoassets which may result in the cryptoassets diminishing in value or you
              being unable to complete a Smart Contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any site and/or application may be suspended or terminated for any or no reason, which may limit your
              access to your cryptoassets.
            </li>
            <li>
              That the Site could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, which would impede or
              limit the ability of Tempus to continue to make available the Tempus Protocol and, thus, could impede or
              limit your ability to access or use the Site.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand that the Ethereum blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and
              security risks when using the Site in addition to uncertainty relating to cryptoassets and transactions
              therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Ethereum blockchain is variable and may
              increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain, which may
              result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Site.
            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge that the Site may be subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating
              any code provided by the Site. This warning and others Tempus provides in these Terms in no way evidence
              or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing or accessing the
              Site.
            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking or
              other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to the
              Site, and could result in the theft or loss of your cryptoassets. To the extent possible, we intend to
              update Tempus-developed smart contracts related to the Site to account for any advances in cryptography
              and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological
              advancements, but that intention does not guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Site.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Accordingly, you expressly agree that:
          <ul>
            <li>
              You assume all risk in connection with your access and use of the Site, the Tempus Protocol and the Smart
              Contracts.
            </li>
            <li>
              You alone are responsible for securing the private key(s) associated with your Smart Contracts. You
              acknowledge that we do not have access to your private key(s) and that losing control of your private
              key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to cryptoassets on the Ethereum blockchain.
              Neither Tempus nor any other person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your cryptoassets. If
              your private key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to transfer your cryptoassets to any other
              blockchain address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value or utility
              from the cryptoassets that you may hold.
            </li>
            <li>
              You expressly waive and release Tempus from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages
              arising from or in any way related to your use of the Site, the Tempus Protocol or the Smart Contracts.
